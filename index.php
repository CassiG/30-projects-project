      <p>30 Projects Project is a side ... well, project, by me: <a href="http://www.cassigallagher.com">Cassi Gallagher</a>. As someone who has a passion for design, code, illustration, and far too much more (call it the multipotentialite in me), I've always found myself learning as much as a possibly can. However, I found this can be a dangerous trap. I found myself learning by reading blog posts, watching videos, but then not doing much else. I would never implement that learning. And that, friends, can get you into trouble. So I decided to implement. Turn what I learned into 30 projects released ever week. So sit back, check in, read my companion blog, and learn with me!</p>
